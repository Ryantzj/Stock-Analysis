('Jul 22, 2014 08:05 AM', 'benson911', 'Getting tougher  BAT faces an uphill task domestically due to the increase in excise duty  and weaker consumer spending. Its contract manufacturing is also  experiencing declining volumes. JTI is also expected to be a more  aggressive competitor now that it is a private entity.   Given the dim outlook, we maintain  our Reduce rating on BAT. The  operating environment going forward  will be tough due to the weaker  consumer spending and high illicit  trade. Its dividend yield is also not  compelling in view of the risks. Switch  to F&B or REITs for yields.  High selling price dampens  sales volume...  Industry sales volumes have been  weak due to the increase in excise  duties as consumers downtrade to  cheaper alternatives, typically illicit  cigarettes. The excise duty increase in  Sep, two years after the last hike,  further dampened sales, especially  since consumers are now also facing  higher living costs due to the  impending implementation of the  GST and the likelihood of gradual  subsidy cuts. To recap, the  government unexpectedly announced  a sharp 14% increase in excise duty in  Sep 2013 and BAT responded by  raising its selling prices \xe2\x80\x93 the third  time in 11 months \xe2\x80\x93 by RM1.50 per  pack for both premium and  value-for-money (VFM) segments.  ...But helped to increase net  profit  The sharp increase in selling prices  indeed helped to improve profit. In  1QFY14, while its domestic and  contract manufacturing volumes fell  by 7.9% and 23% yoy, respectively, its  net profit rose 10.4% yoy against a  revenue increase of 5.3% yoy.  Expect tough road ahead  Although sales volume improved qoq,  this could be due to the government\xe2\x80\x99s  initial effort to clamp down the illicit  market between Mar and May 2014.  With the weakening consumer  spending and the impending GST  implementation, which may raise  cigarettes prices, we think sales  volume has more downside risks than  upside potential. While selling price  increase could bump up profits in the  near term, it is not a long term  solution as any price increase will  cause the illicit cigarettes to spike up.  Furthermore, we believe that as JTI  has been taken private, will be more  aggressive in fighting for market share,  putting more pressure on BAT.')

('Apr 20, 2015 07:22 AM', 'johnny cash', 'Prices reduced to pre-GST levels On 17 April 2015, BAT announced that it has reduced its selling prices to pre-GST levels in order to remain competitive against JTI, which kept its selling prices unchanged after GST was implemented. This is BAT\xe2\x80\x99s second price reduction in less than a week. The recent price competition in the industry shows that price hikes may no longer be effective to raise profits. We cut our FY15-17 EPS forecasts by 2-3% to factor in lower selling prices and higher sales volume from lower loss of market share. Maintain Reduce on BAT, with a lower DDM-based target price. The second price cut and competitive environment are key de-rating catalysts. We prefer the brewers for dividend yield plays. What Happened BAT has reduced its selling prices by RM0.30/pack to pre-GST levels, effective 17 April 2015. BAT\xe2\x80\x99s premium cigarettes are now being sold for RM13.50/pack, while its value-for-money (VFM) cigarettes are being sold for RM12/pack. This is the second time that BAT has reduced prices in less than one week. On 1 April 2015, BAT raised its prices by RM0.50/pack due to the implementation of GST. However, it reduced its selling prices by RM0.20/pack after two weeks to remain competitive against PMI, which decided not to raise selling prices as much as BAT, and JTI, which kept its selling prices at pre-GST levels. What We Think BAT\xe2\x80\x99s decision to reduce prices again was within our expectations, as it would lose market share if it maintained the higher selling prices. Steeper-than-expected sales volume decline may have prompted BAT\xe2\x80\x99s second round of price cuts. Reverting to pre-GST prices means that BAT is absorbing the GST, which will weigh on margins. Following its first price reduction a few days ago, BAT\xe2\x80\x99s premium selling price of RM13.80/pack was RM0.10 below PMI\xe2\x80\x99s but higher than JTI\xe2\x80\x99s RM13.50/pack. BAT\xe2\x80\x99s VFM selling price of RM12.30/pack was also higher than JTI\xe2\x80\x99s RM12/pack. Our checks today revealed that PMI is still maintaining its premium and VFM selling prices at RM13.90/pack and RM12.30/pack, respectively. We do not dismiss the possibility of PMI reducing prices to protect its market share. What You Should Do Reduce exposure. Regulatory risks will be a constant battle for BAT, while consumption is expected to be weak due to slower consumer spending in 2015. In our view, the recent price competition demonstrates that it will be difficult for BAT to raise prices to counter the persistent drop in volumes going forward.')
